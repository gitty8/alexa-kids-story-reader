One day a crow was feeling very thirsty. On a hot summer day, she flew here and there in search of water but in vain. She continued to search hard but couldnâ€™t find any water to quench her thirst. Then after a long time, she found a pitcher, with a little water in it.

The neck of the pitcher was too long and the water level too low. The crow could not reach the water with her beak. She saw many pebbles around. Suddenly, the crow had an idea. She picked thepebbles one by one and dropped them in the pitcher. And lo! The level of water slowly rose to the top. The crow drank it thirstily. She was very happy.

This story proves that if you try hard enough you can overcome any problem.
