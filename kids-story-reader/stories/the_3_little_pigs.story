Once upon a time <break time="1s"/>  there were three little pigs. <break time="1s"/> One pig <break time="1s"/> built a house of straw <break time="1s"/> while the second pig built his house with sticks. <break time="1s"/>They built their houses very quickly <break time="1s"/> and then sang and danced all day <break time="1s"/> because they were lazy. <break time="1s"/>The third little pig worked hard <break time="1s"/> all day <break time="1s"/> and built his house with bricks.<break time="1s"/>
A big bad wolf <break time="1s"/> saw the two little pigs <break time="1s"/> while they danced and played <break time="1s"/> and thought, “What juicy tender meals they will make!” <break time="1s"/> He chased the two pigs <break time="1s"/> and they ran and hid in their houses.<break time="1s"/> The big bad wolf <break time="1s"/> went to the first house <break time="1s"/> and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in minutes. <break time="1s"/>The frightened little pig <break time="1s"/> ran to the second pig’s house <break time="1s"/> that was made of sticks. <break time="1s"/> The big bad wolf now <break time="1s"/> came to this house and <break time="1s"/> huffed and puffed and blew the house down in hardly any time.<break time="1s"/> Now, the two little pigs were terrified <break time="1s"/> and ran to the third pig’s house <break time="1s"/> that was made of bricks.

The big bad wolf <break time="1s"/> tried to huff and puff and blow the house down, <break time="1s"/> but he could not. <break time="1s"/> He kept trying for hours <break time="1s"/> but the house was very strong <break time="1s"/> and the little pigs were safe inside.<break time="1s"/> He tried to enter through the chimney <break time="1s"/> but the third little pig <break time="1s"/> boiled a big pot of water and <break time="1s"/> kept it below the chimney. <break time="1s"/> The wolf fell into it and died.

<break time="1s"/> The two little pigs now <break time="1s"/> felt sorry for having been so lazy. <break time="1s"/>They too built their houses with bricks <break time="1s"/>and lived happily ever after.
